Weather Application using Tkinter GUI
A desktop weather application built with Python and Tkinter that fetches real-time data from OpenWeatherMap. It features a modern GUI, light/dark themes (with weather-based auto theme), smart suggestions, recent city history, and a temperature bar chart using Matplotlib.

Features

1. Search weather by city (temperature, humidity, wind, condition)

2. Auto theme switch (clear → light, rain/storm → dark) + manual toggle

3. Smart suggestions based on conditions (e.g., carry an umbrella)

4. Timestamped results

5. Recent cities history (stores last 5 searches in history.txt)

6. In-app temperature chart for recent cities (Matplotlib)

7.  Robust error handling (API errors, empty input, bad responses)
